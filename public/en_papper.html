			The Pangolin project is based on a blockchain DAPP application in the Pangolin Traffic Encryption Protocol. "Pangolin" uses secure encryption, which costs more than 90% of the cost of similarly centralized products. It is suitable for high-speed viewing of video, game entertainment, massive social, mass business, design and development, study abroad, papers and other application scenarios. The current Pangolin beta has been released and is free to use. The download address is

				[1] The official free version of Pangolin will be released before September 5, 2019.</li>
			<li class="remark-list">
			  [2]  In October 2019, the Pangolin agreement completed the micro-payment channel R&D test. The official version of Pangolin will be launched. Users will pay for the mines that provide the flow according to the actual usage. All calculation methods are completed through smart contracts.
			</li>
			<li class="remark-list">
			  [3] In October 2019, the official version was launched after the launch of the mining pool and mining machine channel. The mining pool is the distributor and guarantor of the Pangolin token fee. The mining machine is the exporter of the flow and the beneficiary. To ensure the normal and efficient trust of the network, the construction of the mining pool and mining machine requires a certain amount of "Pangolin" mortgage currency, the specific number will be announced the first time before the official version is released.

			<li class="remark-list">
			  [4] In October 2019, the official version will be launched in Android, IOS, Windows, Mac and other versions.

			<li class="remark-list">
			  [5] On August 24, 2019, the Pangolin token (abbreviation: LIN) was released for the first phase of smart contract exchange. The total circulation of "Pangolin" tokens was 420 million pieces, and the first period of smart contract exchange quotas was 21 million pieces, accounting for the total amount. 5%, 1ETH=300LIN, contract redemption address: 0x1EE4CddD4127393b581130b644F5A67b8d5F5C49. The second and third phases of sales are 25%, the proportion is to be determined, all of which are redeemed through the smart contract, the minimum conversion unit is 0.1 ETH, the contract address is automatically converted, and the real-time block confirmation is received. Smart contract redemption is recommended to use 5 times the normal miner's fee to ensure a smooth exchange.

			<li class="remark-list">
			  [6] The “Pangolin” team holds 30% of the total issued currency, with a total of 5% of the total issuance as a community reward, and a total of 35% of the total issuance to the users who built the mining pool mining machine in the previous period.

		  	As the number of users of Pangolin continues to increase, the number of mine users increases and the flow application is more stable and faster. At present, the mining machines supported by Pangolin can be routers, home computers, servers, cloud hosts and other equipment. Miners will only get Token incentives if they contribute their own upstream bandwidth.
